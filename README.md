## Welcome to the AspNetErrorHandler repository!

Worried about managing **unhandled errors** in your Asp.Net applications?

This is an **error chain** for managing them, allowing:
- Navigate to an Error Page.
- Write the error in a DataBase.
- Write the error in the Windows EventLog.
- Send an email with the error, to your 1st level support.
